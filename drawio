# Model to Diagram in draw.io

Is it possible to extend draw.io in order to use model driven diagraming?

Ideas:

## Write a Plugin for draw.io
pro
* can use UI in order to manipulate model
con
* viewModel as basis for business model

## Generate Diagram from a file or text
pro
* separation between model and view model
con
* unclear how to edit model
